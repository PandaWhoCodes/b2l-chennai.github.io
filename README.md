## Getting Started (builing the website locally) üõ†

To get starting developing, we really recommend to clone the website locally and start developing on your machine.

This will allow you to **preview what the generated site** will look like in your browser locally. Jekyll comes also with a *auto-regenerate* feature, this will allow you to quickly iterate over different changes to the website (useful if you're touching the CSS files). More info about the *auto-regenerate* feature on the [Jekyll usage page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

### Linux

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) with your package manager.
```
Debian
sudo apt install ruby

ArchLinux
sudo pacman -S ruby
```

2. Clone this repository (you need `git` installed).
```
git clone https://github.com/b2l-chennai/b2l-chennai.github.io.git
cd b2l-chennai.github.io/
```

3. To configure gems user-wide add the following line to your shell configuration files, for example `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
```
export GEM_HOME=$(ruby -e 'print Gem.user_dir')
```

4. Open your terminal and install `jekyll` and `bundler`
```
gem install jekyll
gem install bundler
```

5. To run executable gems, without typing the full location, run the following command or add it to your shell configuration files, for example `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
```
PATH=$(ruby -e 'print Gem.user_dir')/bin:$PATH
```

6. To install gems into `GEM_HOME`
```
bundle install
```

7. Serve the website with the following command,
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the local website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

### Mac OS

To be able to build the site locally, you need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index.html) installed. [Please follow this link to install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index.html)

1. Clone this repository (you need `git` installed).
```
git clone https://github.com/b2l-chennai/b2l-chennai.github.io.git
cd b2l-chennai.github.io/
```
2. Open your terminal and install `ruby`, `jekyll` and `bundler` (skip the related command if you already have the package installed).
```
brew install ruby
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install bundler
```
3. Serve the website with the following command
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the local website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

### Windows
You must have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for windows installed in your system.

1. Download and install **Ruby** and **Rubygems** using [rubyInstaller for windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/)

2. Using git bash, clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/b2l-chennai/b2l-chennai.github.io.git
cd b2l-chennai.github.io/
```
2. On your terminal install `jekyll` and `bundler`
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```
3. Serve the website with the following command
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the local website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

### Docker

1. Be sure to have Docker installed on your local machine
```
Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install docker

ArchLinux
sudo pacman -S docker
```

2. Clone this repository (you need `git` on your machine)
```
git clone https://github.com/b2l-chennai/b2l-chennai.github.io.git
cd b2l-chennai.github.io/
```

3. Run a Docker container with `jekyll/jekyll` image and serve the site
```
docker run --rm -it \
-p 4000:4000 -v "$PWD":/srv/jekyll \
jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the local website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

This command will download the [`jekyll/jekyll`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/builder/) image from Docker Hub and build a container from that image.  
Container port 4000 is linked to `localhost:4000`, so that you can access the site from that address.  
Every time this container is executed, it'll automatically do a `bundle install`, thus retrieving all Gem dependencies before building and serving.

## Writing a post üìù

To add a new post to the blog page, you need to create a new file in the [`_post`](https://github.com/b2l-chennai/b2l-chennai.github.io/tree/master/_posts) folder. Please follow the naming of the file, like:
```
2018-01-29-hello-world.md
```

The structure of the blog post file should be as following:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: <TITLE OF YOUR BLOGPOST>
date:   <DATE OF YOUR BLOGPOST LIKE '2018-01-29 13:50:39'>
categories: <LIST OF SPACE SEPARATED CATEGORIES>
---

<BODY OF YOUR BLOGPOST>
```
